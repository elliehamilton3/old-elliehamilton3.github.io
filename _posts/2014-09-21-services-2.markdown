We created an application that allowed users to manage a variety of aspects involved in student life. We implemented a calendar which students could use to add events including modules (lecture/seminars), shifts for a job, society events, one-off events etc. In addition to this, we included the functionality to manage tasks and deadlines (tasks with a date/time). Furthermore, students can join groups to work on projects etc.
